# Poker Sudoku

A unique twist on the classic Sudoku puzzle game that uses playing cards instead of numbers!

## Game Concept

Instead of using numbers 1-9, this Sudoku game uses playing cards with ranks Ace through 9. The traditional Sudoku rules apply:
- Each row must contain one of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Each column must contain one of each rank
- Each 3x3 box must contain one of each rank
- Cards of the same rank but different suits are considered the same for Sudoku rules

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **9x9 Sudoku grid** with poker card ranks (Ace through 9)
- **Three difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Real-time conflict detection** - highlights conflicting cards in red
- **Card selection system** - tap cards to place them on the grid
- **Hint system** - get suggestions for difficult positions

### Game Controls
- **New Game** - Start a fresh puzzle with your chosen difficulty
- **Check Solution** - Verify if your current solution is correct
- **Hint** - Get a suggested card for the selected position
- **Timer** - Track how long you've been playing
- **Move Counter** - See how many moves you've made

### Visual Design
- **Beautiful card graphics** with proper suit colors (red for hearts/diamonds, black for clubs/spades)
- **Clear grid layout** with 3x3 box borders
- **Intuitive card selector** showing all available cards
- **Modern Material Design** UI with smooth animations

## How to Play

2. **Select a Cell**: Tap on any empty cell in the grid to select it
3. **Choose a Card**: Tap a card from the bottom selector
4. **Place the Card**: Tap "Place" or the card will be placed automatically
5. **Complete the Puzzle**: Fill all cells following Sudoku rules
6. **Win**: Complete the puzzle without conflicts to win!

## Game Rules

### Traditional Sudoku Rules
- Fill the 9√ó9 grid with cards so that each row, column, and 3√ó3 box contains exactly one of each rank
- Use cards with ranks: Ace (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

### Poker Sudoku Specifics
- **36 cards total**: One of each rank (Ace-9) in each suit (‚ô†‚ô£‚ô•‚ô¶)

- **Visual distinction**: Red cards (‚ô•‚ô¶) and black cards (‚ô†‚ô£) for easy identification
- **Conflict highlighting**: Conflicting cards are highlighted in red

## Future Enhancements
